"""
Data Migration Script: v1 to v2
================================

This script migrates data from the old status-based system (v1) to the new 
quantity-based system with sales tracking (v2).

IMPORTANT: Make a backup of your database before running this script!

What this script does:
1. For each product with old 'status' field:
   - If status was 'IN_STOCK': Sets quantity_total to old quantity value
   - If status was 'SOLD': Creates a Sale record and sets quantity_total
2. Removes old status and quantity fields (handled by Django migrations)

Usage:
    python migrate_v1_to_v2.py
